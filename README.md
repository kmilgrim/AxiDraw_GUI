# AxiDraw_GUI

This GUI was made to make spotting experiments with the AxiDraw much more user friendly. The user can indicate pen delay values and the AxiDraw will make two rows per pen delay value. 

How to use:
1) connect your AxiDraw (plug the AxiDraw in, run the GUI Program, and press the "connect" button.)

2) Enter the pen delay values you want. Entering 100, 200, 300 repectively will result in 6 rows of 9 spots each, with 1.5mm between each spot, and every two rows will be a different pen delay value. In this case, the top two rows will be with a pen delay of 100ms, the middle two will be with a pen delay of 200ms, and the bottom two will be with a pen delay of 300ms (where the "top" of the chip is closest to the axidraw. 

Other functions:

*you can change the height of the pen when it is "up" and when it is "down". Just enter the percentage you would like for each position and click "update" to ensure your changes were processed. 
*no matter where the AxiDraw is, you can return home by pressing the "home" button.
*the "Draw Placement Box" button, when pressed, will prompt the AxiDraw to draw a box that is the exact dimensions for the chips used in the OCN laboratory at Boston University. You can use this if you are running an experiment on a chip placed on paper, and you want to ensure that the chip will be under the AxiDraw. 

The Modify Window is a work in progress. If you have any ideas on its functionality, please email kmilgrim@bu.edu.
